# Asking-ChatGPT-for-Challange
This will have codes that I asked ChatGPT to challenge me to do. Firstly, I give keywords to ChatGPT which it'll see and give me a challenge program to do by only using those keywords. None other are allowed. Sometimes there might be change in rule but those will be written in the python file as a comment
